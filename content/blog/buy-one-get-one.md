Spoiler Alert - This story is pointless and has no ending.

It's a strange town I'm in. Everything here comes in two.
When you buy one, you get two.

I was walking down the road on a quiet evening with loads of money.
So much money that I could buy anything there.

I saw an old house and went inside, thinking I might buy this.

It was a big mansion with damaged walls and ceilings, no doors and windows, full of stories and no one tell them.
The hall was theatre size big. 
There was an elevated part in the front, which gave it an auditorium feel.

A man entered the house when he saw me from outside.
He introduced himself to be a retired construction worker.
He was neighbor to this house for years.
He said no one knows owners of this house. There are haunted house stories to it, just like any old house has.

Some local drunkards come here to party and sleep here sometimes. Maybe that's why haunting stories go around. It's not ghosts, it's the alcohol laughs that is haunting this place, he said jokingly. 

I asked him about buying and renovating this place,
and he sounded happy to help in renovation work. 
He gave me a list of things I need to renovate the place and guided me to market where I can find those things.
